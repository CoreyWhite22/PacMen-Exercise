# PacMen Exercise

<img src="PacMan1.png" width='300'/>

Description:

In this exercise there are two buttons. The first button is an "Add PacMan" button, which adds stationary PacMen to your screen. The second button is a "Start Game" button, which makes each PacMan start moving at a random speed and bounce off any walls that they collide with.

How to Run:

Simply drag the Index.html file directly from the directory folder. Then you can press the buttons as many times as you want.

Roadmap of future improvements:

I would like to make it so that the PacMen are bouncing off of eachother as well. It would also like to add a second button to add ghosts. Once the game starts, if the ghosts touch the PacMen then the pacman would be deleted.
